This directory contains test data, at least one file per supported report type.

Samples have been selected as the ones with less unset values in the available
dataset.  Some extra cases are there to test regressions; they are listed here:

obs4-142.13803.bufr
  Contains a longitude of -100.230000, which in the past was converted to
  -10.023 because the internal storage space was not long enough to store the
  initial '-'.  The dry bulb temperature had a similar bug.
