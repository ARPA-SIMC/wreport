Description: library for working with weather reports
 libwreport is a C++ library for working with weather reports.
 .
 The main feature of libwreport is a powerful decoder and encoder for the BUFR
 and CREX formats.
 .
 It also provides a useful abstraction to handle values found in weather
 reports, with awareness of significant digits, measurement units, variable
 descriptions, unit conversion and attributes on variables.
 .
 Features provided:
 .
  * Read and write BUFR version 2, 3, and 4
  * Read and write CREX
  * Unit conversion
  * Handling of physical variables
